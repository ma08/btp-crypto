2*33 desired pairs

2*3 values per entry

2^2 values per entry - 2^34 hash table entries


Precomputation 

struct size 16

2^32 entries - file size is 32GB  RAM size is 96GB = 64GB+32GB

2^33 entries - file size is 16GB+32GB RAM size is 160GB = 128GB + 32GB

struct size 12

2^32 entries - file size is 32GB = 16GB+16GB. RAM size is 80GB = 48GB+32GB   (file - count 16GB, RAM - linkedlist headers-32GB)
2^33 entries - file size is 48GB = 16GB+32GB. RAM size is 128GB = 96GB +32GB
assuming count doesn't increase > 2^32 for an entry
2^34 entries - file size is 80GB = 16GB+64GB. RAM size is 224GB = 192GB +32GB


Loading
2^32 entries - RAM size is 32GB = 16GB + 16GB
2^33 entries - RAM size is 64GB = 32GB + 32GB
2^34 entries - RAM size is 96GB = 32GB + 64GB


Desired Pairs generation

one diagonal 
RAM size is 80GB = 48GB+32GB


So we can use generate two partitions of hash tables (2^33), write them to file.
Load them both and create the whole hash table and write it to file.
